# Order Menu
Welcome to the Order Menu Project! This is a simple Python program that allows users to select items from a menu. It demonstrate error handling using `try...except` and ensures a smooth user experience.

## Features
* **Menu display:** the menu is displaying with a list of available items, each labeled with an index for easy selection
*  **Error Handling with** `try...except`: the program uses a `try...except` block to manage invalid inputs such as non numeric entries or out of range index values
* **User input validation:** the user is prompted to enter a valid index and if they provide an invalid one they are given another chance to make a correct selection
* **Loop for repeated attempts:** the program allows users to retry their input until they select a valid menu item
